# Software:

### Install:
To begin, please clone this repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/mastrofran/Auto-Column-Chromatography.git
```
The XFAVR program that runs on the Arduino to control the device is located in the **CODE** subfolder and was written using C++. The recommended way to run the XFAVR program on an Arduino device is to download the official Arduino program for your chosen operating system. This program is used to communicate with Arduino microcontroller via a computer. Please see this [link](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to download the Arduino software for your operating system. Detailed instructions on how to use this program are provided in the **instructions.pdf** file.

# Documentation
Official documentation is located in the **instructions.pdf** file in this repository. 

# Hardware:
A list of materials needed for this project are located in the documentation.
